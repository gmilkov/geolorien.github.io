# Privacy Policy for Skyfall

**Effective Date:** 2026-01-14

**Developer:** Georgi Milkov

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how Skyfall ("the App", "we", "our") handles information when you use our mobile application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.

## Information We Collect

**Skyfall does not collect any personal information from its users.**

We do not collect, store, or transmit:
- Names or contact information
- Email addresses
- Location data
- Device identifiers (for our own purposes)
- Usage analytics
- Any other personally identifiable information

All game progress and settings are stored locally on your device and are never transmitted to our servers.

## Third-Party Services

### Google AdMob

The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect certain information to serve personalized or non-personalized ads. This may include:

- Device identifiers (such as advertising ID)
- IP address
- General location (country/region level)
- App usage data for ad serving purposes

Google's use of information is governed by the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

You can learn more about how Google uses data and your choices regarding personalized advertising:
- [How Google uses data](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites)
- [Google's Advertising policies](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads)

Users in applicable regions (EU, UK, etc.) will be presented with consent options for personalized advertising in compliance with applicable regulations.

## Data Storage

All game-related data (progress, settings, high scores) is stored locally on your device. This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Is not accessible to us
- Is not backed up to any cloud service by the App
- Can be deleted by uninstalling the App or clearing the App's data

## Children's Privacy

Skyfall does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or applicable age in your jurisdiction). Since we do not collect personal data from any users, children can safely use the App.

The App displays advertisements through Google AdMob. For users identified as children or where child-directed treatment applies, AdMob will serve only non-personalized, age-appropriate advertisements in compliance with COPPA and other applicable children's privacy regulations.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with an updated "Effective Date" at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.

Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
